We chose this design to implement the small details of Deadwood such as Roles and Cards as relatively simple
fields of the more complex classes such as GameSystem and Player, which control the logic of the game. We felt that the
nature of the game warranted heavy use of aggregation because of all the different components that, for instance, a
Location has (Cards, Roles of both types, and Set). The two types of Roles provided an obvious chance to utilize
inheritance and polymorphism.
