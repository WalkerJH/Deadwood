Deadwood: The Computer Game
By Kai Broach and Walker Herring

---Running The Game---

Run Deadwood.java, and use the terminal to interact with the game.
There are no command line arguments or config files to worry about.

The following files are needed to run the game:
Board.java
board.xml
Card.java
CardDeck.java
xards.xml
Deadwood.java
Dice.java
ExtraRole.java
GameSystem.java
Location.java
ParseXML.java
Payout.java
Player.java
Role.java
Set.java
StarringRole.java

---Interacting With The Game----

Type "help" for a list of commands.
To move, simply type "move" and hit enter.
The game will then present you with movement options.
Acting, rehearsing, and upgrading work in the same fashion.

If you give a command the system does not recognize, and no
error message is printed, assume the game has returned to its
default  state and you have been kicked out of any sub-menus.

Commands are case-insensitive.
